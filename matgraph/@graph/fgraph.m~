function fgraph(g,n,func)
% fgraph(g,n,func) -- create a graph based on a function.
% n is the number of vertices 
% func is the name of a function that is called with three arguments:
% The numbrer of vertices n, and the two verti
% We create a graph g that has n vertices and an edge from i to j iff
% func(n,i,j) is nonzero. The function is supplied by the user and it is the
% user's responsibility that this function be symmetric.
